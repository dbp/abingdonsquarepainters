          <h2>About the Cooperative</h2>
          <p>The Abingdon Square Painters takes its name from its earliest location at Abingdon Square in New York’s Greenwich Village. By 1967 economics and a need for more space provided the impetus for relocation to a much beloved studio on 14th Street.</p>

          <p>Economic necessity again intruded itself and we made the move in 2009 to our present location in Long Island City. Long Island City has proven to be a welcome stimulus opening us to new members, neighbors and opportunities.</p>

          <p>We are not a gallery nor an artist’s collective, but a cooperative. We do have a teaching mission but no dominant artistic philosophy or orientation to which the members adhere. We are a space where abstract, representational, and conceptual artists can WORK. We have officers mainly to get the financial and administrative tasks of running an organization done. There is no pecking order, No one dominates or derides, and no "Main Artist" or “School of….” mentality is at play. In fact no judgment of others work,unless requested, but rather an atmosphere of appreciation for what each individual brings to the challenge of being an artist and creating meaningful work.</p>

          <p>We are a group of individuals freely doing our own creative "thing" while being careful not to inhibit or limit our fellow members. All fine art media are practiced although we do not have facilities for print or computer or video art but we have had a few sculptors over the years.We ARE unique in New York in being a space where artists can work 24 hours aday, pay very little for use of the space and -while selected by portfolio review -do not have any commercial or exhibition oriented goal that must be met by our members. Our members range from professional exhibiting artists and art teachers to individuals who are interested primarily in personal expression and development.</p>

          <p>We invite you to browse this site, get acquainted with the work of our members and hope to meet you at our annual exhibition or Long Island City Open Studios!</p>
